# Bank-Account-Management

The program is written in such a way that it cannot be displayed beautifully
in the terminal inside the IDE, so I suggest you run the bat or exe file.

When you create a new account , the card number will be shown to you
for a few seconds and then you will be redirected to the login page.
It was possible to enter the account directly after creating an account,
but I wanted the program to be similar to creating an account for big sites.

Just a normal bank account!
